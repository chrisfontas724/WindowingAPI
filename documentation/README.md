# Windowing
A wrapper window API for easy integration with rendering APIs such as Vulkan. In just a couple lines of code you can set up a run loop for a game or similar application and receive input and mouse events.


# Example

An example for how to use the windowing system can be seen by building and running main.cpp with cmake.

First make a build directory and cd into int:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    
Then build with cmake:
    
    cmake ..
    cmake build
    
Now you can run the demo!

    ./WindowDemo
